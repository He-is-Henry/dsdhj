      <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        All manuscripts submitted to the Delta State Dental and Health Journal
        must comply with internationally accepted ethical standards. Research
        involving human subjects must adhere to the principles of the
        Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Authors must confirm that the research was reviewed and approved by the
        appropriate institutional research and ethics committee, and that
        informed consent was obtained from participants involved in the study. A
        clear ethics approval statement should be included in the manuscript at
        the time of submission.
      </p>

      <p>
        For retrospective studies involving patient records, a statement of
        approval or exemption must be provided. Manuscripts involving
        experimental animals must confirm compliance with institutional animal
        care guidelines.
      </p>

      <h3>Patient Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        Authors must obtain written informed consent for the publication of
        identifiable patient information, including photographs or case details.
        Identifying information should only be included when absolutely
        necessary and with appropriate permissions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The editorial team reserves the right to request copies of documentation
        related to ethics approval or patient consent as part of the review
        process.
